        depicts the metamorphosis of an analog work of art into a digital one, 
        and the transformation of the persona of Aaron Swartz and his astounding 
        works using AI tools. Litto transformed his photo into a living person 
        through AI face reconstruction and Hid√©o Snes gave Aaron his natural 
        voice through AI speech synthesis. All in all it is as if he would talk with us 
        directly through an alternate reality. The Guerilla Open Access Manifesto is a 
        permanent virtual monument at the Artificial Museum.
