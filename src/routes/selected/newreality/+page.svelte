  <h3>So. You’re starving. Figuratively.</h3>

  <div class="content">
    <p>
      Ordering a pizza has never been simpler. Or, if you’re feeling really adventurous, you could
      google a recipe for original Italian dough, put on a Youtube-tutorial, skype with a college
      friend from Rome, remotely set the right temperature, instagram your freshly made pizza and
      post a witty article about the newfound ease of Italian pizzacraft on your lifestyle blog.
      Congratulations. New media has made you an expert on baked goods and while you’re munching
      on thinly sliced goodness, arguing politics on twitter you come accross a hashtag.
      #NOTJUSTANUMBER And suddenly, from the comfort of your home, within the dozing smell of
      molten cheese, you’re thrust into the lives and afterimages of those who went loudly and are
      remembered in silence.
