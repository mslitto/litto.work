          Recording the painting process of 5 works that have been in continuous development for seven years.
        </p>
        <p>
          The temporal units of the painting process<br>
          (canvas on oil) have been documented digitally
          and manifested as virtual artifacts, taking the form of videos and 3d sculptures.
        </p>
        <p>
          The work is both success and failure, the motive halfway discarded.
          It is a living act consisting of frustration and pleasure.
        </p>

        <p>
          By documenting and storing the intermediate steps of the painting,
          the time component becomes a crucial part of this work series.
          Lined up snapshots become narrative,
          actors emerge, become carriers of the whole story,
          just to leave their position again and again until they fade away.
