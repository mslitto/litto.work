           We are cyborgs and live on the moon, watching earth from above. We have been watching since before the rise of humanity. And for a long time we were pleased, seeing humans grow below us, living their desires, building new desires and learning the concept of love.  

          But then, humans learned to divide themselves by superficial differences, and started praying to false, made up gods, solely created to give legitimacy to human brutality and followed the path of war and power. 

          Finally, not too long ago, humanity vanished.

          This sad and destructive fact forced 
          us to go back in time. 
          change history by voting for one of us, choose wisely.
